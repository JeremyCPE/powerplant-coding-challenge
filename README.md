# powerplant-coding-challenge

Challenge for GEM (Global Energy Management) - https://gems.engie.com/

## Build & Launch

To launch it, you need at least SDK .NET 6.0
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the "CodingChallenge" project
2. Run "dotnet run"
3. You can post any data with the good format to receive the desired response


The algorithm sort each powerplant *first* by efficiency *then* by cost. So it will use (if he can) always the windturbine in first.
